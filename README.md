# Form Validation App with Firebase

## Overview
This is a simple web application that validates form inputs and stores the submitted data in a Firebase database. The app ensures that the data entered by the user meets specific validation rules (e.g., email format, password strength) before allowing the submission. Once the form passes all validation checks, the data is saved in a Firebase database for further use.
